# P2 Playlist Landing Page

This project creates a landing page for your **Polaroid P2 speaker** that allows anyone to easily add songs to a shared **YouTube Music playlist**.

## Features

- **NFC Trigger:** Tap the Polaroid P2 speaker to open the playlist in the browser.
- **Simple Playlist Access:** Users can join and contribute to the playlist directly from the page.
- **Custom URL:** The page can be customized with your own playlist ID for easy access.
- **Generated by ChatGPT:** This simple, user-friendly webpage was created with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **NFC-enabled device (Polaroid P2 speaker or compatible)** for triggering the page.
- **YouTube Music playlist URL:** Replace the placeholder in the page’s code with your actual YouTube playlist link.
- A **web hosting platform** (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own server) to host the HTML file.

### Steps

1. **Download the HTML file:**  
   Download the latest version of the `p2_playlist_page.html` file.

2. **Replace Playlist ID:**  
   In the HTML code, replace `YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID` with the actual ID of your YouTube Music playlist.  
   Example: `https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID`

3. **Host the File:**  
   Upload the HTML file to a web hosting service such as **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**. If you're unfamiliar with this, there are plenty of guides on how to deploy simple HTML files.

4. **Set Up NFC:**  
   If you're using a Polaroid P2 speaker with NFC, program the NFC tag to redirect to the hosted webpage.
